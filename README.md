# Express Api Seed

### Description
This is a seed project for a basic lightweight express API. It is setup to act
as a blog post API for example purposes but can be easily adapted to any need.

The API is built to work with MongoDB. The included ApiConfig.json
is where you can specify your MongoDB connection settings. If you wish to use a
different DB service other than MongoDB, you will have to build that into the
application yourself.

### Setup Instructions
1. Make sure NodeJS is installed.
2. Open up a CMD(or terminal) window in the directory of this application.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Start the application by running `npm start`.
5. To view the application, visit [http://localhost:3030/api/post](http://localhost:3030/api/post) in a browser.
